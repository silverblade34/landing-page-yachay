# Paddle Mobile Web Payments Starter

[Paddle Billing](https://www.paddle.com/solutions/web-stores?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-in-app-checkout-starter) is the developer-first merchant of record. We take care of payments, tax, subscriptions, and metrics with one unified API that does it all.

This is a Next.js starter project for implementing marketing pages, including a pricing page, and Paddle checkout on Web for an iOS app.

As of April 30, 2025, Apple's updated App Store rules allow app developers to use third-party payment processors like Paddle for in-app purchases. This starter shows you how to implement a web-based checkout that can be opened from iOS apps.

Even though you're redirecting users to Web to complete their purchase, **Apple pay is still supported**.
